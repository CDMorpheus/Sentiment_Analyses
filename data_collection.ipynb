       "'\\nWalter: My name is Walter Hartwell White  I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104  To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt  I am speaking to my family now  Skyler you are the love of my life  I hope you know that  Walter Junior you\\'re my big man  There are going to be some things  Things that you\\'ll come to learn about me in the next few days  I just want you to know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart  Goodbye \\nWalter Jr: What the hell is this? \\nHank: That\\'s why they hire men  Jesus, it\\'s not gonna bite you, all right? Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn\\'t he? Hey, Walt  Everybody listen up, listen up, listen up! I\\'m gonna give a toast  A little toast to my brother-in-law  Come here  Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin, but we\\'re not gonna hold that against you  Because your heart\\'s in the right place, man  Your heart\\'s in the right place  We love you, man  We love you  Everybody! To Walt! Nostrovia! \\nHank(on the news): At which point we apprehended three individuals and placed them into custody  I\\'m proud to say the outstanding professionalism of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque District Office resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine being taken off the streets  \\nHank: Well, it\\'s not the most we ever took  It\\'s easy money until we catch you  Walt, just say the word and I\\'ll take you on a ride-along  You can watch us knock down a meth lab  Get a little excitement in your life  \\nWalter: So what tells you it\\'s a meth lab? \\nHank: All right, come on, come on  All right  School bus is clear  Got the green light  \\nWalter: I was curious  Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn\\'t picture that  There\\'s a lot of money in it, huh? \\nJesse: You want to cook crystal meth? You? You and, uh and me? \\nMarie: What the hell is this? \\nSkyler: Turning 50 is a big deal  I mean, I\\'m sure as hell not looking forward to 40  You\\'re gonna be a complete basket case  \\nJesse: Yeah, well, we\\'ll see about that  What the hell is this? \\nJesse: Yeah  I know a dude who wants to sell his  He just goes camping with it  But a mobile meth lab? That\\'d be the b*mb  I mean, drive way out in the boonies  Be all evasive  \\nWalter: These are my good clothes  I can\\'t go home smelling like a meth lab  \\nJesse: This is glass grade  I mean, you got   Jesus, you got crystals in here two inches, three inches long  This is pure glass  You\\'re a g*dd*mn artist  This is art, Mr  White  \\nJesse: Kraze, how you doing, my man? You got a new dog  Right on, man  What\\'s his name? Yeah, I had a dog like that once, except maybe, like, twice as big  Super purebred  Now, me personally, I would train him to go straight for the nuts    \\n\\nWalter: But don\\'t worry  I\\'m also doing all the dishes  Nice? Follow me  There\\'s also orange juice and grapefruit juice, which, personally, as you know, I\\'ve never been a fan of  But considering all the polyphenols and the albuminoids, can\\'t hurt  \\nJesse: Look, we talked about this, okay? I\\'d sell the house, we\\'d split it 50/50  That was the deal  What the hell happened? \\nMr  Pinkman: What happened is you\\'re a speed manufacturer  \\nJesse: What did you do, huh? She\\'s lying there dying, and where the hell are you? \\nWalter: New Mexican Christmas style, red and green chilies  \\nJesse: Hey, thanks again, P  I made sure this stock knock exterminator put me on his speed dial  Two nights tops  \\nPaul: How awesome would that be? Come on  Look  What? I cut all the green parts off like you  Just eat them  Please? \\nWalter: Your legs are fine  You just have to stick with it  Don\\'t set limits for yourself, Walt  You\\'re all right  We\\'ll get this  I promise  Now let\\'s just try again  All right? All right  Here we go  Well, you don\\'t need to just take off, but all right, here we go  Slow it down just a little bit  All right, we have a turn coming up here, so prepare to apply the brakes  Prepare, Walt, for the brakes  The brakes, the brakes  \\nClovis: What the hell you doing here? You smell like shit  \\nClovis: I don\\'t know  There\\'s a bunch of stuff in there  There\\'s something called methylamine  Me Meth However the hell you pronounce it  Methylamine  I don\\'t know  I banged on it  It sounds pretty full to me  Holy shit  How much? \\nWalter: I wanted to apologize for everything  My desire for privacy  My emotional unavailability  Having cancer doesn\\'t excuse all that  I haven\\'t been a good partner to you, and for that I\\'m very sorry  I love you  And I love this family  And I just want to make sure that we don\\'t lose contact  \\nWalter: To come to my house and park on my street, driving this vehicle  What the hell is wrong with you? I\\'m really asking  \\n\\n\\n\\nMerkert: Bring me up to speed on Salamanca  \\nHank: Okay  So things are quiet  Not a lot of crystal on the streets right now  \\nHank: Like one hell of a promotion  \\nJesse: You rock  You won\\'t regret this  \\nJane: And don\\'t think for one second you have squatters\\' rights, because you don\\'t  If you blow this, I want you gone  I know guys that\\'ll have your skinny ass out back by the dumpster faster than you can blink  I\\'ll fill it in  Just sign your name  Which is what, by the way? \\nWalter: So you\\'re going to, what? Snort meth off a bowie knife? You gonna b*at your homies to death when they diss you? \\nJesse: Look, I know some guys  All right? I can create a network  We control production and distribution  That way, we stay off the front lines while moving some serious glass  The point here is to make money, right? Sky-high stacks  That\\'s not the point? \\nJesse: I remember  You cook, I sell  That was the division of labor when we started all this  And that\\'s exactly how we should have kept it  \\'Cause I sure as hell didn\\'t find myself locked in a trunk or on my knees with a g*n to my head before your greedy old ass came along, all right? \\nJesse: No b*mb, no beer, no weed  You smoke it up on your own time  We\\'re talking business here  So listen up  This is how it goes  I front each of you an ounce  You sell it for 2,500  I keep the two, you keep the five  No cutting it  You sell it as is, all right? \\nMarie: Excuse me  You\\'re right  It\\'s the Paris of the Southwest  Please, it\\'s Texas, for God\\'s sake  Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell  Human heads, they leave  The cartels, they litter the place with human heads  \\nJesse: Yo, I mean, seriously  What the hell do you want me to do, huh? \\n\\n\\n\\nJesse: Jesus, how the hell do you spell \"street\" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T? \\nSpooge: Shut the hell up about it  \\nJesse: What the hell am I supposed to do with this? \\nJesse: Where the hell did you get this? \\nSpooge: We roll like the breeze, for real  All we did, we just walked in all smooth-like  Nobody even noticed  \\nJesse: Sit  All right, I swear to God I will sh**t you both in the face! Now chill! You, get that thing open  You sit the hell down, and no throwing things  Where\\'s the kid? The kid! The little kid! \\nJesse: What the hell kind of mother are you? How about you feed the kid a decent meal every now and then? Give him a bath  Put some baby powder on him  Get him some decent TV to watch  What is this shit? Are you serious? \\nWalter: What would you know about me? What would your presumption about me be, exactly? That I should go begging for your charity? And you waving your checkbook around, like some magic wand, is going to make me forget how you and Elliott cut me out? \\nWalter: Little rich girl just adding to your millions  \\nSpooge’s Wife: I need    I need to even out  Let me get a hit of that crystal  \\nSpooge: Shut the hell up, you dumb skank  I\\'m trying to concentrate  \\n\\n\\n\\nSkyler: It\\'s a little girl  We\\'re very excited  \\nSkyler: Tenth grade and he\\'s just growing like a weed  He\\'s taller than I am now  I\\'m betting 6\\'3\", 6\\'4\" by the time he\\'s finished  \\nTortuga: The SkyMall  Give me the SkyMall, would you? Vanco, new guy don\\'t speak Spanish  What\\'s up? Hey, white boy, better learn Espanol, huh? This ain\\'t Branson, Missouri  You know what I\\'m talking about? You know what? I\\'ll teach you  It means \"Let\\'s make a deal \" So go ahead  We\\'re waiting  Vaya, vaya  Right here  Item SS4G  Yankee Stadium, \"Final Season\" Commemorative Baseball, hand-signed by Derek Jeter  Vanco, write this down  Man, watch out  Large size floor runner  Look at that  It\\'s a rug you put on the floor, except for it looks like a hundred dollar bill  I love them  Get me 20 of them  I\\'m going to put them all over my casa  \\nSkyler: They\\'ve gone green since then  They have some kind of green welding or something  I didn\\'t smell anything when I was in there  \\nJesse: I was kind of missing my TV  I was thinking maybe I\\'d hit Costco  Snag a big-ass wide screen  So What you drawing? Damn  That\\'s good  It\\'d make a hell of a tat  \\nHank: Is that your guy? I think that\\'s your guy  What the hell is he doing down there? \\nJesse: We\\'re set  Our boys are ready  Gonna be some mad cheddar  Cheddar, Mr  White  Fat stacks, d*ad presidents  Cash money  We\\'re going to own this city  \\nTed: Looks like they got you all set up  \\nTed: Damn  It\\'s grape juice  I\\'ve been making the girls breakfast in the morning  \\nJesse: It\\'s got that thing where the blacks are, like, you know, really, really, really black, and the Dolby six-point-whatever, so it\\'ll really rock the house  But I\\'ll, you know I\\'ll keep it way down  Of course  I don\\'t know what the hell\\'s taking so long  Come on \\n\\n\\n\\nJesse: God  It\\'s me  Where the hell were you? I called, like, 20 times  \\nWalter: A gold mine we can\\'t sell  We need a proper infrastructure  We need foot soldiers and dealers on a street level that are rock solid  We need muscle, and we need enforcers  Payback  That\\'s what we need  God  I mean, this entire process has just been so, it\\'s always been one step forward and two steps back  We need your help  \\nSaul: Let\\'s start with some tough love, all right? Ready for this? Here goes  You two suck at peddling meth  Period  So give up on trying to do it all yourselves  Hell, I\\'m amazed you got this far  \\nJesse: What about after? After you\\'re gonna make up some new magic number? Like, \"I got bills  I got bills  I gotta make more \" \\nTed: We have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies  They anticipate their needs for the next quarter  Most of the time, they overestimate  So I just let them roll their overages into the next order and if I don\\'t, they\\'ll go elsewhere  Obviously, we forgot or didn\\'t go back and adjust the revenue entries  I know it\\'s wrong from an accounting standpoint, but as you can see, the money\\'s coming in  Eventually, as you can see  \\n\\n\\n\\nBartender: Careful, senor  Hot day like today too much oil in the machine can cause it to blow a gasket  \\nTortuga: There are two kinds of men in this world  Those who drink and those who pour  Shut up and fill my glass  Hey, you two  Yes, you  I used to be just like you  Worked dirt for the man till my hands bled  But no more  Because I learned that a man can never drink his fill by waiting in line for the tap \\nTortuga: I love it! What a great pet it will make  Thank you, boss! \\nSkyler: What? What the hell are you doing in there? \\nSkyler: Sweetheart  I\\'m sorry  I\\'m sorry  It\\'s okay  It\\'s okay, my girl  Yes, it\\'s okay  It\\'s okay  Mama\\'s got you  I\\'ve got you  Yes  Yes  \\nSkyler: My husband makes meth  Methamphetamine  \\nSteve: This spice looks like it\\'s been through a couple of guys already  So when you headed back down to El Paso? \\nSteve: Ain\\'t jack going on up here  It\\'s quiet as hell  \\n\\n\\n\\nCara: I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes  I party  But that stuff\\'s really addictive, right? \\nSaul: What the hell is wrong with you? You act like you\\'re the first guy this happened to  I caught my second wife screwing my stepdad, okay? It\\'s a cruel world, Walt  Grow up  \\nWalt: What? No, no, that\\'s not true  When the hell did I say that? \\nSaul: Good! \"Oh, boohoo, I won\\'t cook meth anymore\"  You\\'re a crybaby! Who needs you? And I\\'m unplugging the website, so no more money laundering! How do you like that? \\nWalt: What in the hell is this? \\nJesse: What the hell is your problem? All I\\'m asking is for you to set a meet  \\nWalt: Oh, they said it was the b*mb  And who were they, I wonder? A bunch of meth heads? \\nHank: Remind me to get a vasectomy  Okay, it\\'s after 9, so this bar that Girl George is at probably wall-to-wall dirtbags by now  Let\\'s go have a little looky-loo, see if we can\\'t find this M-named clown  \\nSaul: Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV  Did any little piece fall on your property? I\\'m not looking for an entire wing here, Mr  Linkas  It could be a nut or a bolt  It could be a bag of peanuts just so long as it caused you pain and suffering  Oh, no, no, no  Closed  Calling you back  You had your chance  I told you to get him cooking again  You blew it off and now it\\'s too late  The guy\\'s gone mass maniac on us! All I wanted was to show you two your potential  And what do I get in return? A bone contusion  You wanna see the scar? I wish you two had…Hi, there  How in the hell did you get Walt to…\\nHank: Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy  Okay, what else? Piercings, jewelry, distinctive articles of clothing  Come on  Come on  Listen to me  It\\'s real important that I find the person that had these drugs  So if you can remember anything else  Come on, think  Come on, now  Come on  \\n\\n\\n\\nSkyler: Oh, my God, I love this floor  This feels fantastic  Can you control the temperature? \\nJesse: You know what? Escalate this  My meth, my money! I will be a one-man glass factory  I will rock that RV 24… \\nGuy: No, no, no  What the hell are you doing up there? Are you some kind of a pervert?\\nMarie: You know I love my little pookums  You can leave her with me for the next 18 years as far as I\\'m concerned  \\nSkyler: I just don\\'t know what the hell I\\'m doing anymore, you know? It\\'s like I\\'m paralyzed like if I take a step in any direction I\\'m gonna make a spectacular mistake  God, I could go for a glass of wine about now  You wanna go to? Sorry, never mind  Anyway breaking news is I am sleeping with my boss and I don\\'t know why  Yep  That\\'s a lie  I do know why  I mean, he\\'s a lovely guy  He\\'s a really good person but, I mean, it\\'s not like we\\'re ever gonna…Somehow, and I can\\'t actually believe it but my entire family sees me as some sort of…My own sister, my brother-in-law  My teenage son tells me I\\'m a bitch  And you say tell him the truth  Tell him about his father but I can\\'t  Ever  How could I? And this man that I\\'m seeing, you know as wrong as I know it is as much as I know I\\'m probably doing it to make Walt leave me it is the only thing in my day where I don\\'t feel like I\\'m drowning  \\nJesse: What the hell is that supposed to mean? \\nJesse: What in the hell just happened? You\\'re my lawyer, not his! \\nHank: May I ask why? I mean, it\\'s a great way to get the family together for an affordable vacation  It must\\'ve been a blow when it went missing  \\n\\n\\n\\nSaul: My advice, that\\'s probably not a good strategy  They\\'re scared of you right now  They want nothing to do with you  But if you hit them they\\'re forced to hit back hard  I mean, they will turn over every rock hither, thither and yon until someone spills the beans on you and anyone associated with you  Present company included \\nHank: I\\'m convinced Mr  Pinkman was involved in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl-2 methamphetamine, specifically what we call the blue meth  I tracked him to a scrap yard where he stored an early-\\'80s camper  An RV  While waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle which I believe to be a rolling meth lab, I received a telephone call telling me my wife, Marie, had been injured in an accident  Upon hearing the news, I left Mr  Pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife  Arriving at the hospital, I learned the emergency call was a hoax  My wife, fortunately, was unharmed  So I immediately went back to the salvage yard, but the RV was gone  Most likely destroyed on site \\nLawyer: The word of a meth head \\nDealer: Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests  Right here  Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded, non-interwoven Kevlar fiber  Stop a b*llet like a soft wang against a Quaker girl  Ain\\'t getting through  And lightweight? So lightweight, you\\'ll forget you\\'re wearing it \\nWalt: Gale  What temperature did you set here? \\nMarie: I squeezed some orange juice  You want a glass of orange juice? \\nHank: No, it wasn\\'t one mistake  I\\'ve been unraveling, you know? I don\\'t sleep at night anymore  I freeze  I freeze up  My chest gets all tight  I can\\'t breathe  Just, I panic  Ever since that Salamanca thing  I mean, Tuco Salamanca  If ever a scumbag deserved a b*llet between the eyes, It changed me  And I can\\'t seem to control it  I tried to fight it  But then El Paso  And it\\'s just gotten worse  What I did to Pinkman, that\\'s not who I\\'m supposed to be  That\\'s not me  All this, everything that\\'s happened, I swear to God, Marie, I think the universe is trying to tell me something and I\\'m finally ready to listen  I\\'m just not the man I thought I was  I think I\\'m done as a cop  Now, this is not an easy decision, but it is one that I have to make  \\nJesse: I am not turning down the money  I am turning down you  You get it? I want nothing to do with you  Ever since I met you everything I\\'ve ever cared about is gone  Ruined, turned to shit, d*ad  Ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg  I have never been more alone  I have nothing! No one! All right? It\\'s all gone! Get it? No  No, no  Why? Why would you get it? What do you even care, as long as you get what you want? Right? You don\\'t give a shit about me  You said I was no good  I\\'m nothing! Why would you want me, huh? You said my meth is inferior, right? Right? Hey, you said my cook was garbage! Hey, screw you, man! Screw you \\nWalt: Your meth is good, Jesse  As good as mine \\nMerkert: Who the hell knows? Maybe you have a guardian angel \\nHank: It went fine  Well, fine means what it means, yeah  I\\'ll tell you all about it when I get home, okay? Yeah  It\\'s- Yeah, it\\'s just- I don\\'t know, baby, I just think I think we may be okay  Yeah  Okay  I love you too  Schrader \\n\\n\\n\\nBeen keeping an eye on that blue meth of yours \\nTo hell with the plan \\nIn one stroke, he bloodied both sides set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest \\nI sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass  Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark  It even smelled good  You know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was It was perfect \\nI traded it for an ounce of weed \\nLook, why don\\'t you go in and take a long bath? - I put some fresh sheets on the bed \\nHe was responsible for the Death Star \\nMaybe all we need is the meth \\nIt\\'s meth \\nOnly reason I have a hope in hell is because it\\'s long gone \\n\\n\\n\\nI-- I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids, and, uh I love you \\nI said I guarded him, like backup, like a second set of eyes \\nYeah? What for? A little birdie told me there\\'s some guys in there that have 3 pounds of our product which they\\'re selling and which they sure as hell didn\\'t get from us \\nNow, what you may not know about meth heads-- Maybe you do-- They\\'re kind of unpredictable \\nWho the hell are you? Tucker! I\\'m, uh, here to buy \\nsit-in-the-car business, but I know meth heads \\nTucker! Tucker! Tucker! Who the hell are you? I-- Hey \\nWho the hell are you? Hey, I\\'m, uh-- I\\'m a friend of Tucker\\'s \\nAnd I promise to always go the speed limit or below, way below \\n\\n\\n\\nBut-- But, uh, cancer\\'s cancer, so-- Oh, to hell with your cancer \\nIt had been heat treated, so it had that classic cast to it, that rose, almost salmon hue, you know? Hey, Walt, there\\'s no rock show, okay? I just said that so Marie wouldn\\'t freak \\nMay I help you with your order? I, uh-- What the hell is he-- Just, uh, made sure it was secure \\nHe ain\\'t going to set up no meeting \\n\\n\\n\\nWho supplies them? What\\'s the base of operations? So I do a little diggin\\', and bingo! Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center \\nI mean, I-- You know-- You know, I just-- I would just really love to be the one to be able to-- to take you there, and-- I mean, I have just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you, - and helping you \\nYou\\'re all set \\nBut seriously, what-- What was the deal with Gus? - The deal? - The Terminator shit? Walking right into the b*ll*ts? What the hell was he doing? The cartel needs Gus \\nAnyway, they\\'ve been holding them off, but between the cartel taking pot shots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it\\'s like, what do you call, a rock and a hard place situation \\nLook, there was just this one big pot of stew, okay? He just made this one big pot, and we both ate from it-- What was I supposed to do? Huh? Poison myself? Two hours and 18 minutes, and you couldn\\'t figure out a way to give it to him \\n\\n\\n\\nLike watching weeds grow, huh? [chuckles] Nah, this job\\'s as boring as hell \\nYeah, a chemist who was in possession of hand-drawn plans for a meth super-lab, and was visited by none other that Gus Fring just days before he was capped in the face, okay? Shit, this is starting to feel like a-- like Three Days on the Condor, you know? Anyway, an industrial laundry would be one hell of a place to hide a-- hide a meth lab \\nGet the hell outta my house \\nWh-- - What the hell happened to you? - Saul-- Saul, this man that we spoke of before-- this-- this person that you said could-- could disappear me, give me a whole new life-- - Yeah \\nHe\\'ll put you up in a safe house until everything is set \\n\\n\\n\\nShh, shh, shh Okay, my love \\nThat\\'s all, but I think Los Pollos Hermanos is a front for the biggest meth distributor in the Southwest \\nIt\\'s a perfect spot for a meth superlab \\nHey, what if I\\'m right? Even if you were right-- and you ain\\'t-- but if you were, there\\'s no way in hell a judge is going to give me a search warrant-- Search warrant? What happened to good, old-fashioned knock and talk? Oh, that\\'s right \\nOh, and, Dennis, can you clear out some of your people for us? Confuses the dog\\'s nose \\nWhat\\'s that mean? And why the hell you drag me down here for? You want your money, don\\'t you? I assume that you do \\nI\\'m not catching, like, anything you\\'re saying, and what the hell is your problem? You haven\\'t talked to your partner, have you? No, not since last night \\nBrock-- why did you poison him? Who\\'s Brock? You saw him in my living room just last night \\nThat\\'s when he must\\'ve stolen it off of me, right? That\\'s the plan? Was that the plan? Jesse, why? Why, in God\\'s name, would I poison a child? To get back at me \\n\\n\\n\\nPreviously on AMC\\'s Breaking Bad I had the cigarette with the ricine in my pack this morning! Why did you poison him? Admit it! I did not do this!

Life is good, Skyler \\nOkay?
